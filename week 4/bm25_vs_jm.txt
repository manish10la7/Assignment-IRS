Comparative Analysis: Okapi BM25 vs Language Model with Jelinek-Mercer Smoothing

BM25 relies heavily on term frequency and document length normalization, making it suitable for
traditional keyword-based search systems. It is easy to understand and tune for specific domains.
In contrast, the Jelinek-Mercer Language Model uses probabilistic smoothing to estimate query likelihoods,
allowing it to capture broader term distributions across the collection.

Practical application differences:
- BM25 is often preferred in web search engines due to its efficiency and strong empirical performance.
- Jelinek-Mercer is valuable in academic and research search systems where the presence of related terms
  matters more than exact term matches.

Both models can be implemented in Python using libraries like `rank_bm25` for BM25 and `whoosh` or custom
language model scripts for Jelinek-Mercer. Understanding their strengths and limitations is key to
choosing the appropriate scoring function for a given information retrieval task.
Example: Comparing rankings of scientific papers with BM25 vs JM shows BM25 favors short, keyword-rich
abstracts, while JM may favor papers with broader contextual relevance.

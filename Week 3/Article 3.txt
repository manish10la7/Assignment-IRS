Article 3: Microplastics and Impacts on Coral Reef Ecosystems
Microplastics (MPs), plastic fragments smaller than 5 mm, have emerged as a significant threat to coral reef ecosystems, which are already stressed by rising temperatures and ocean acidification. Corals, the primary reef builders, have been documented to ingest microplastic particles, often mistaking them for their natural prey (plankton).

The physical presence of MPs can lead to species-specific negative impacts on coral health, including tissue necrosis, increased mucus production, and decreased growth rates. The ingestion and contact with microplastics can also lead to elevated energy demands for the coral, as they attempt to expel the foreign material. Furthermore, microplastics can serve as vectors for toxic chemicals (like POPs and heavy metals) and harmful pathogens, introducing them directly into the coral tissue. Microplastic contamination, especially when combined with other stressors like thermal stress (which causes bleaching), exacerbates the overall decline of these critical habitats, leading to compromised health and reduced survival rates for the countless species that depend on them.

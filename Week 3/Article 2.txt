Article 2: Eutrophication and the Formation of Oceanic Dead Zones
Eutrophication, the excessive enrichment of water bodies with nutrients, is the primary human-caused factor leading to the formation of oceanic dead zones (areas of hypoxia, or low oxygen). This process is fueled mainly by the runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural fertilizers, sewage discharge, and industrial waste.

When these excess nutrients enter coastal waters, they trigger a rapid overgrowth of algae, known as an algal bloom. While alive, this dense layer of algae blocks sunlight, inhibiting the photosynthesis of submerged plants. Crucially, when the massive bloom eventually dies, the decomposition process is carried out by bacteria, which consume vast amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water. This severe oxygen depletion makes the area uninhabitable for most mobile marine life, such as fish, crabs, and shrimp, forcing them to flee or perish. Habitats that were once rich in biodiversity become biological deserts. One of the largest examples in the world is the recurring dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, which is largely driven by nutrient-laden water from the Mississippi River Basin.

Article 5: Physical and Lethal Harm from Macroplastic Debris
Macroplastic debris—large items like plastic bags, fishing nets, and bottles—is responsible for significant physical harm and mortality across nearly all groups of marine animals.

Entanglement: Discarded fishing gear, often termed "ghost nets," are particularly lethal, trapping and immobilizing marine mammals, turtles, and seabirds. Entanglement restricts movement, causes severe lacerations and infection, and frequently leads to drowning or starvation.

Ingestion: Many animals mistakenly ingest plastic debris. Sea turtles, for example, frequently consume plastic bags confused for jellyfish. This ingestion creates a false sense of fullness, leading to starvation because the animal stops seeking actual food. The plastic can also cause internal blockages, lacerations, and the slow leaching of chemical additives into the animal's body. Over 1,300 marine species have been reported to be affected by entanglement and ingestion, demonstrating the widespread and indiscriminate nature of this form of pollution.

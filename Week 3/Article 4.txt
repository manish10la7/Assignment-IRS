Article 4: Oil Spills and Long-Term Effects on Birds and Mammals
While immediate mortality from major oil spills is highly visible, the long-term effects of petroleum pollution on marine animals, particularly birds and mammals, are often chronic and debilitating.

For seabirds, oil destroys the insulating and water-repellent properties of their feathers, leading rapidly to hypothermia and death. Birds also ingest oil while preening their contaminated feathers, causing severe internal damage, including lesions in the liver and kidneys. For marine mammals with fur, like sea otters and some seals, oil destroys their insulation, causing hypothermia. Air-breathing mammals like dolphins and whales can inhale volatile oil components at the surface, leading to respiratory inflammation, lung damage, and suppressed immune function. Long-term studies following spills have shown lingering effects, such as reduced population growth, chronic disease, and high mortality rates in eggs and juveniles, indicating that the toxic components of oil, like Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), persist in the environment and food web for years, leading to bioaccumulation and reproductive impairment.

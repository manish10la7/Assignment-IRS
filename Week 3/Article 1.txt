Article 1: Chemical Contaminants and Biomagnification in Apex Predators
The exposure of marine mammals and other apex predators, such as killer whales and certain shark species, to chemical pollution is highly concerning due to the process of biomagnification. Man-made persistent pollutants, including Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) like Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals like mercury, are ingested and assimilated by smaller organisms at the base of the food chain. As these organisms are consumed by predators, the concentration of the contaminants increases with each step upwards in the food web.

Marine mammals are highly suitable bioindicators for monitoring long-term environmental pollution because they are at the top of the food chains and possess extensive fat stores (blubber) where these lipophilic (fat-dissolving) contaminants accumulate over time. Exposure to high levels of POPs, many of which are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can have devastating consequences for these animals, including suppressed immune systems (making them more susceptible to disease outbreaks), reproductive failure, birth defects, and alterations to energy metabolism. Even decades after their ban, legacy pollutants like PCBs remain in the environment and continue to cycle through the marine food web, posing a chronic risk to the survival of vulnerable populations.
